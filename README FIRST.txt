BEFORE LOADING THE PROGRAM YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THE ZIP COMPONENT FROM

I wrote this program (still in progress) that allows me to search for examples that I have downloaded from Planet-Source-Code over the years. Some of it is written using examples I seen there. I hope you enjoy it and if given enough feedback I will continue to post changes as I make them. Thanks for taking the time to look at this.

The Zip Component is a free dll that allows you to zip and unzip files. The author is very responsive to any problems that I have found and has even added features for me.
