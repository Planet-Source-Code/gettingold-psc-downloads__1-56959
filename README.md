### Description

Over the years I've collected quite a few code and program examples. The problem is that I may know I have an example of how to do something, but I can't find it. This program will open a downloaded file and parse the PSC-readme file, then insert the information into a database that can then be search on. I hope you enjoy it. Please read the readme file prior to running the code as there is a free dll that must be downloaded from another site first.
